This is an interactive 3D data visualization project about visualizing the solar system, aiming at displaying the relationship between gravitational force and centripetal force. The relationship is, in fact, an equilibrium, which fixes every planet on its own orbital path. Compare to planar data deliverables, a 3D visualization can show the relationship more straightforward and solid, also more aesthetically appealing. It also helps in comprehending the vast distances between planets and other celestial bodies, providing a more realistic sense of scale, distance, and the spatial relationships within the solar system.

This project is written in Vue, using THREE.js. The dataset I applied is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/planet-dataset. The texure of each planet is from the website:https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/. I use the variables Diameter to determine the size of each sphere object, the variable Distance_from_Sun to determine the distance of each planet between each other, and other variables to display the features of each planet on its own interactive pop up window.

In this project, I enabled zoomming and panning so that users can deeply explore the universe. Users can also explore more stories of the planets by double clicking them. The pop up window on the right hand side after double-click will display the numeric value of gravitational force and centripetal force, also other features of the planet such as its mass, diameter, rotation period and so on.
